**Current Focus:** Refactoring `_modelProviders` in `lib/ai.dart` to use a map.

**Recent Changes:**
- Initial Memory Bank setup (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`)

**Next Steps:**
- Read `lib/ai.dart` to understand the current implementation of `_modelProviders`.
- Plan the refactoring approach.
- Implement the refactoring.
- Update `progress.md` and other relevant Memory Bank files.

**Active Decisions:**
- Use a `Map<String, ModelProvider>` for `_modelProviders` for better lookup by name.

**Learnings and Insights:**
- Project appears to be a Flutter app for dictionary/translation, potentially with AI features.

**Important Patterns/Preferences:** (To be determined)
